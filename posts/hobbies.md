Outside of coding, I do various things to have fun.

The main video game I play is Tetris. I enjoy all types of Tetris, but I mostly focus on fast modern Tetris games like [Jstris](https://jstris.jezevec10.com) and [Tetrio](https://tetr.io). I have been one of the top 100 fastest sprinters in Tetris, and I enjoy honing my skills to compete against others in versus Tetris.
