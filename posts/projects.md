# **Projects**

## [**This Personal Website!** ![github-mark.png](github-mark.png "Github Redirect")](https://github.com/doublesmokedbaconandpie/personal-website):
### August 2023 – Present

I wanted to create a personal website, and even though there are a plethora of different services with gorgeous templates and effects, I decided to challenge myself and create a website from scratch.

#### Skills Used: 
* Javascript, HTML, CSS
* Next.js, React
* Tailwind CSS

## [**Webnovel Tracking List** ![github-mark.png](github-mark.png "Github Redirect")](https://github.com/doublesmokedbaconandpie/Personal-Webnovel-Ranking-List):
### July 2023 – Present

Another one of my hobbies is reading webnovels, most often translated webnovels, and the main way the English speaking world keeps track of their webnovels is through a website known as [https://www.novelupdates.com](https://www.novelupdates.com). There ended up being features of the website that I wasn't satisfied with, which led me to develop this project.

The personal webnovel tracking list more compactly organizes one's reading list and offers more features in order to search through one's list of webnovels quickly. This is in progress, though I hope to add more support for other people in the future. 

#### Skills Used:
* Python, SQL
* Javascript, HTML, CSS

## [**Tetris Statistics Compiler** ![github-mark.png](github-mark.png "Github Redirect")](https://github.com/doublesmokedbaconandpie/Jstris-Stats-Discord-Bot): 
### November 2021 - May 2022

As a competitive Tetris player, it's important to find the right resources and tools in order to train yourself more effective, and I think that [**Jstris**](https://jstris.jezevec10.com) is one of the best clients to do so. However, there are some potentially useful statistics that aren't shown natively on the website.

I identified a potential userbase of Tetris players who wanted more features from Jstris and created a Discord bot in order to serve them the statistics they wanted. **50+ competive Tetris players** ended up benefitting from using the Discord Bot. 

#### Skills Used:
* Python
* Webscraping 
* APIs (Discord)
